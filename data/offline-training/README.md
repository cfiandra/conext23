### Sub-folders

- [datasets](datasets): the folder contains two `pkl` files with one dataset per agent
- [pre-trained-agents/embb-agent](pre-trained-agents/embb-agent). Weights for the agent `eMBB` to be used for SHAP analysis
- [pre-trained-agents/urllc_agent](/urllc_agent). Weights for the agent `URLLC` to be used for SHAP analysis
